I like to do the analyses in RMarkdown.
I can then include these files in the thesis, so that the analysis results for the data (stored in the data subfolder in content) can be used in the text.

Depending on the settings print_analysis and print_analysis_results the following section displays some R code or not. Even if the code is not shown, it is executed.

```{r}
# this is where regular R stuff happens

x <- 3 + 4
```
